port-scan--short for port scanner--is a fast, lightweight CLI library that executes a TCP port scan on a list of hosts.

port-scan allows you to add, list, and delete hosts from the list.

port-scan executes a port scan on specified TCP ports. You can customize the target ports using a command line flag.
